# Week 1.3, Session 1: Task 5b

rivers = {
  "London": "Thames", 
  "Leeds": "Aire", 
  "Liverpool": "Mersey",
  "York": "Ouse"
}

# loop through the dict extracting key and value

for c, r in rivers.items():
    print(c, r)

for k in rivers.keys():
    print(k)
    
for v in rivers.values():
    print(v)
# create 2 further for loops to iterate: 1. just through the keys, 2. just through the values
# hint: we looked at built in function for dicts last session
